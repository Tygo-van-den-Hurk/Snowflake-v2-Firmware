Version 0.0.0: OS remapping support, navigation remaps, Custom keys, macros

*OS Remapping Support*

I first added OS detecting support to remap CTRL and GUI. Now, on MacOS your
middle finger is on CMD and on Linux/Windows it's on CTRL. This means that
you can make most shortcuts with your middle finger regardless of the platform.

*Navigation Remaps*

I also added navigation remaps. So on MacOS to go to the start of a file you
press 'CMD + UP', on windows this is 'CTRL + END'. This being different is also
a problem as now it is up to the user to remember the shortcut for each
platform. The keyboard does this under the hood thanks to its OS remapping
support.

*Custom Keys*

There are some keys that sent really weird keycodes to the OS:
'CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + SUPER + RANDOM_KEY'. Since it is unlikely that someone
would press 5 keys by accident we can use these as special keys.

Now you can use these 60 keys as 60 individual keys being pressed. For example
opening your browser, or performing a macro. This is support is up to the OS
though.

*Macros*

QMK supports 2 macro slots. You can use these to record Key actions that the
keyboard will then perform when they are replayed. I'd add more slots, but as
of writing QMK only supports these 2 slots.

*Known Issues*

When making the arrow key combination 'ALT + ARROW' the keyboard successfully
remaps this to 'CTRL + ARROW' instead. However it does first send the 'ALT'
to the PC, which means that especially on linux this can trigger menu bar
use. Meaning that your focus goes from the text box into the menu bar.

Thus far there does not seem to be a solution to this problem.
